# 🛡️ Slade_MITM: Educational MITM Proxy

This project is a basic Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy built using **Python** and **mitmproxy**. It is intended **strictly for educational purposes** such as ethical hacking labs, cybersecurity learning, and traffic inspection in controlled environments.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- mitmproxy (install with `pip install mitmproxy`)

### 🌀 How to Run

**Run in terminal:**
```bash
mitmproxy -s mitm_script.py --listen-port 8888
```

**Or launch GUI:**
```bash
python mitm_gui.py
```

- Configure your browser or device to use `localhost:8080` as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
- Visit any website to see logged requests and responses.
- Stop the proxy with `Ctrl+C`.

### ⚙️ HTTPS Note
You may need to install mitmproxy’s CA certificate for HTTPS interception. The tool provides guidance when needed.

Let me know if you want this broken out into multiple files (e.g. `LICENSE.txt`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`), or committed automatically. Also — do you want to add example logs or expand the GUI features next? I’ve got ideas if you’re game 🔧💡
